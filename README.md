We aim to analyze the factors that affect a vehicle's miles per gallon (MPG). In our investigation, we consider four continuous variables: cab space volume, top speed in mph, engine horsepower, and vehicle weight in 100lbs. To gain a deeper understanding, we employ several analytical and machine learning techniques, including explanatory data analysis (EDA), visualization to identify patterns, data manipulation, multilinear regression models, and an ANOVA test to assess the predictive strength of these variables.

By conducting EDA and manipulating the data, we aim to uncover insights and patterns in the relationship between MPG and the explanatory variables. Visualizations will assist us in visualizing these patterns and understanding their implications.

Furthermore, we will utilize multilinear regression models to create a predictive model that considers the combined influence of cab space volume, top speed, engine horsepower, and vehicle weight on MPG. This approach will help us quantify the individual contributions of each variable and assess their significance in predicting MPG.

Finally, we will conduct an ANOVA test to evaluate the overall strength of the predictive variables. This statistical test will provide insights into the significance of the relationship between the explanatory variables and MPG, helping us determine the most influential factors.

In summary, our analysis aims to investigate the factors influencing MPG in vehicles. By employing various analytical and machine learning strategies, such as EDA, visualization, multilinear regression modeling, and ANOVA testing, we seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between MPG and the continuous variables of cab space volume, top speed, engine horsepower, and vehicle weight.
